## Notes

I have not learned Kotlin or Android app development before. So although I could follow all the steps shown in the videos,
it would have been very challenging if I had to complete the tasks on my own without guidance. But it was fun :)

Also, LiceCap does not support Linux, so I had to switch OS.
